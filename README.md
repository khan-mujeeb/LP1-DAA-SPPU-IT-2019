### Assignment and Problem Statement
---
|ASSIGNMENT| PROBLEM STATEMENT|
|----------|-----------------|
|[Assignment 1](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/LP1-DAA-SPPU-IT-2019/tree/main/Assignment%201)|Write a program to implement Fractional knapsack using Greedy algorithm and 0/1 knapsack using dynamic programming. Show that Greedy strategy does not necessarily yield an optimal solution over a dynamic programming approach.|
|[Assignment 2](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/LP1-DAA-SPPU-IT-2019/tree/main/Assignment%202)|Write a program to implement Bellman-Ford Algorithm using Dynamic Programming and verify the time complexity.|
|[Assignment 3](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/LP1-DAA-SPPU-IT-2019/tree/main/Assignment%203)|Write a recursive program to find the solution of placing n queens on the chessboard so that no two queens attack each other using Backtracking.|
|[Assignment 4](https://github.com/khan-mujeeb/LP1-DAA-SPPU-IT-2019/tree/main/Assignment%204)|Write a program to solve the travelling salesman problem and to print the path and the cost using LC Branch and Bound.|
